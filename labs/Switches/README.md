# Switches Lab
Switches are one of the core networking devices due to their ability to connect multiple devices, direct traffic to specefic destinations, and serve as the backbone in for local communication within private networks.


## Configure two switches
With two switches, devices can communicate locally and share resources such as Files and Printers. In my topology I implemented two switches, and each switch is connected to three PC's via _Straight-Through-Copper_.
Both Switches are connected to each other using _Copper-Cross-Over_.

## Testing
To test reachability for both Switches, I used the **ping** command. As a result both of my ping request came back successfull and all 6 PCs are able to communicate with eachother locally.
