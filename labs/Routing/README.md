# Routing Lab
This lab focuses on fundamentals of routing, which include configuring routers, assigning static routes, VLAN routing,
inter-VLAN, OSPF, EIGRP, NAT, etc). This project will expand upon my existing DHCP + DNS + LAN environment, by introducing a router into the environment.


## Router LAN Configuration
I added the 2911 router above the switch and conneced it to the switch using a _GigabitEthernet uplink._
