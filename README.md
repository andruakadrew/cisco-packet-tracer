# Cisco Packet Tracer Networking Project
I created a my own Cisco Packet Tracer home lab environment, designed to help me practice networking fundamentals, develop troubleshooting skills, and simulate a real world enterprise network.

## Overview
Hands on Cisco Packet Tracer labs designed to demonstrate core network concepts. Each lab focuses on the practical implementation of essential protocols and services used in modern networks.

### Technologies Covered
- DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) - Automated IP address assignment
- DNS (Domain Name System) - Name resolution services
- Static & Dynamic Routing - Network path determination
- VLANs - Network segmentation and traffic management
- NAT/PAT - Address translation techniques
- GRE (Generic Routing Encapsulation)
- Switching & Routing - Layer 2 and Layer 3 operations

### Labs included
1. DHCP Configuration
- **Objective:** Configure DHCP Server to automatically assign IP addresses to network clients
- **Skills:** DHCP pool creation, IP address allocation, gateway and DNS configuration
- **Topology:** Multi PC network with centeralized DHCP server

7. Network Secuirty (ACLs)
 - **Objective:**  Control network traffic using Access Control Lists
 - **Skills:** Standard and extended ACLs, traffic filtering
 - **Topology:** Segmented network with security policies

8. Wireless Home Network Simulation
- **Objective:** Set up a home network using common devices such as a Wireless router, Cable Modem, Laptops, and a Office PC.
- **Skills:** Network implementation, Router installation
- **Topology:** A home environemnt that contains a Wireless router, Cable modem, and multiple end devices such as TV's, PCs and laptops. All network devices in the home are connected to the router, which is then connected to the Modem and provides internet for all users connected to the home network.
