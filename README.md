# Cisco Packet Tracer Networking Project
I created a my own Cisco Packet Tracer home lab environment, designed to help me practice networking fundamentals, develop troubleshooting skills, and simulate a real world enterprise network.

## Overview
Hands on Cisco Packet Tracer labs designed to demonstrate core network concepts. Each lab focuses on the practical implementation of essential protocols and services used in modern networks.

### Technologies Covered
- DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) - Automated IP address assignment
- DNS (Domain Name System) - Name resolution services
- Static & Dynamic Routing - Network path determination
- VLANs - Network segmentation and traffic management
- NAT/PAT - Address translation techniques
- GRE (Generic Routing Encapsulation)
- Switching & Routing - Layer 2 and Layer 3 operations

### Labs included
1. DHCP Configuration
- **Objective:** Configure DHCP Server to automatically assign IP addresses to network clients
- **Skills:** DHCP pool creation, IP address allocation, gateway and DNS configuration
- **Topology:** Multi PC network with centeralized DHCP server

2. DNS Services
- **Objective:** Implement DNS for hostname resolution  
- **Skills:** DNS Server configuration, forward/reverse lookup zones, DNS records
- **Topology:** Client server DNS architecture

3. GRE Tunneling
- **Objective:** Create secure site-to-site GRE tunnel between two networks. 
- **Skills:** Link tunneling, ISP router configuration, GRE configuration 
- **Topology:** Two networks located in different parts of the country, communicating internally through a GRE Linked tunnel.
